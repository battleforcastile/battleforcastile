#  Introducion
**Battle for Castile** is a fantasy card game based on a fictional universe set on the kingdom of Castile (Spain)
during the 13th century.

In this world, creatures of the forest co-exist with powerful wizards and honorable knights at the service of their lords.
There're 3 different classes with unique strengths and weaknesses:

### 1. Creatures
Powerful entities and beasts living deep in the forest. They were expelled by humans centuries back during the "long wars" 
and they are seeking revenge since then.
##### 1.1 Strengths
    - Quick development of the board thanks to many spells that deploy units on the board at the same time
    - Growing spells that affect all minions on the hero side of the board

##### 1.2 Weaknesses
    - Weak end-game due to the lack of big minions
    - No spells that affect the other side of the board

### 2. Kingdom
The reigning kingdom of Castile. A powerful army of knights and magic priests ready to give their lives to prevent
the kingdom from falling into the hands of either the creatures of the forest or outlaws.
##### 1.1 Strengths
    - Strong end-game thanks to big minions with high value
    - Growing spells that affect a single minion

##### 1.2 Weaknesses
    - Slow development of the board due to lack of many "low cost" units
    - No spells that affect the other side of the board


### 3. Outlaws
Merchants and thieves that were exiled from the reining kingdom of Castile. Many of them have fallen into the hands of black magic,
so they are capable of casting powerful destructive spells and invocations. Their desire for revenge makes them incredibly powerful.
##### 1.1 Strengths
    - Strong mid-game thanks to minions with mid value
    - Growing and Damaging spells that affect either side of the board

##### 1.2 Weaknesses
    - Slow development of the board due to lack of "low cost" units
    - Weak end-game of the board due to lack of "high value" units
